# MiddleClickDefinition
A VS extension that lets you use middleclicks to trigger Go To Definition, Go To Implementation, or Peek Definition. This makes navigating code feel more like a browser.

To download the extension, find it on [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=norachuga.MiddleClickDefinition).

This extension is based on the old Ctrl-Click Go To Definition extension by Noah Richards, which became an official part of VS long ago.
